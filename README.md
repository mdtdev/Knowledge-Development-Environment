# Knowledge-Development-Environment

**NDE** - A k**N**owledge **D**evelopment **E**nvironment

Like everyone else, I want to make a [Zettelkasten](https://zettelkasten.de/introduction/) and some other knowledge tools to help me think. Like everyone else, I have found that none of the other tools meet my requirements. Like everyone else, I am stupidly committing to making something new.

Who knew we were all so alike after all?

I do not know what I am doing. If this goes anywhere, I'll happily take contributions, but there is a set of design choices I am looking to support, see the design document.

I have no idea why I am choosing to do this in public!

KnoDev - A Knowledge Development Environment

Like everyone else, I want to make a [Zettelkasten](https://zettelkasten.de/introduction/) and some other knowledge tools to help me think. Like everyone else, I have found that none of the other tools meet most of my requirements. Like everyone else, I am stupidly committing to making something new.

I do not know what I am doing. If this goes anywhere, I'll happily take contributions, but there is a set of design choices I am looking to support, see the design document.
